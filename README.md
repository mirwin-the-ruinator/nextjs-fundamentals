# Next Fundamentals

A lightweight practice project built with **Next.js 15**, **React 19**, and **TypeScript** to explore core Next.js concepts like file-based routing, dynamic routes, server components, and basic API routes.

> **Disclaimer:** This project is intentionally light on styling. Itâ€™s all about learning the framework, soâ€¦ _No Judging!_ ðŸ™ƒ

## Features

- **App Router** (`app/` directory) with nested routes
- **Dynamic Routes** for blog posts (`/blog/[slug]`)
- **Markdown-based Content** rendering for posts
- **Simple SEO** metadata and JSON-LD
- **Basic API Route** example (OpenWeather API integration)
- **Server Components** and **Client Components** usage
- Minimal **Tailwind CSS** setup

## Adding Blog Content

Blog posts are stored as markdown files in:

```
src/app/content/posts/
```

Each post should start with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: 'My First Post'
excerpt: 'This is a short summary.'
banner: '/images/banner.jpg'
date: '2025-08-14'
---

Here is the content of the post...
